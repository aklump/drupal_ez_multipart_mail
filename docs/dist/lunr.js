This module removes the extra effort and requires no configuration to allow for multipart messages which are HTML and plaintext. It improves the display of the plaintext email messages received by your users because they are sent as both HTML and plaintext as soon as this module is enabled.\n\nIt is not a complete multipart solution, because it doesn't support attachments.\n\nThis module provides a render element, which developers can use to generate HTML + text emails very easily at the code level. @see `\\Drupal\\ez_multipart_mail\\Element\\EzMultipartMail`. The HTML and plaintext versions of are independently themed using separate template files: _ez-multipart-html.html.twig_ and _ez-multipart-plain.html.twig_.\n\n## Reasons to Enable this Module\n\n* You can't or don't want to install the [Mail MIME](https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/mailmime) module due to it's dependency on the Pear package, but you still want to send multipart MIME mails.\n* As a developer, you want to send HTML emails without involving your theme.\n* You need to send HTML emails where `$message['body']` has HTML that will not be filtered or touched by the mail system.\n* You need to control the `text\/plain` and `text\/html` email parts of an email separately.\n\n## What it Does\n\n* Turn key solution to send HTML emails in Drupal.\n* Automatically inlines CSS styles.\n* Automatically converts plaintext emails to HTML (@see service `ez_multipart_mail.text_to_html`)\n\n## Install with Composer\n\n1. Because this is an unpublished package, you must define it's repository in\n   your project's _composer.json_ file. Add the following to _composer.json_ in\n   the `repositories` array:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"type\": \"github\",\n        \"url\": \"https:\/\/github.com\/aklump\/drupal_ez_multipart_mail\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Require this package:\n\n    ```\n    composer require drupal\/ez_multipart_mail:^0.3\n    ```\n3. Add the installed directory to _.gitignore_\n\n   ```php\n   \/web\/modules\/custom\/ez_multipart_mail\/\n   ```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Configure [HTML Mail module](https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/htmlmail) as necessary to successfully send HTML mails.\n2. Do not install or enable the PEAR mime classes integration.\n3. Do not enable _Provide simple plain\/text alternative of the HTML mail._.\n4. Post-filtering is not necessary, but may still be used.\n6. Enable this module.\n7. Resend your test message (\/admin\/config\/system\/htmlmail\/test) and view the email source. You should see that the email is now encoded as `Content-Type: multipart\/alternative`. In your email client try viewing plain, viewing formatted, and viewing source to make comparisons.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* [HTML Mail module](https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/htmlmail)\n* Tested on Drupal 9\n* Not yet tested on Drupal 8\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you find this project useful... please consider [making a donation](https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4E5KZHDQCEUV8&item_name=Gratitude%20for%20aklump%2Fez_multipart_mail)\n.\n\n## Technically Speaking\n\nIf an email is sent with a body that is an element of type `#ez_multipart_mail` then the body will will rendered based on that element.\n\n---\nOn the otherhand, if the body is an array or scalar--that is normal drupal emails--then a multipart will be built per the following...\n\nThis module will convert `text\/plain` emails to `text\/html` using the `ez_multipart_mail.text_to_html` service.\n\nThen it hands the message to `\\Drupal\\htmlmail\\Plugin\\Mail\\HtmlMailSystem::format()` for formatting. If that method creates a content type of `multipart\/alternative` then this module returns the message.\n\nIf it remains `text\/html` then it will be converted to `multipart\/alternative` using the body returned from `HtmlMailSystem::format()` and a plaintext version from the original message.\n\n## Developers: Sending Multipart Emails\n\n### Debug Mode\n\nIf you enable the _Debug_ mode at \/admin\/config\/system\/htmlmail, when you send your emails, the Messenger service will receive the HTML and then the full body of your email. The sent email will also contain debugging info per the HTML mail module.\n\n### I want to send an email with html body, no templates or theme wrappers.\n\nThe answer is to set the `$message['body']` like this:\n\n```php\n$message['body'] = [\n  '#type' => 'ez_multipart_mail',\n  '#html' => \\Drupal\\Core\\Render\\Markup::create('Lorem'),\n  '#plain' => \\Drupal\\Core\\Render\\Markup::create('# Lorem'),\n];\n```\n\nYou can see that you have absolute control of both HTML and plain. Also by using `Markup::create()` you ensure no filtering will take place.\n\n### Something is Wrapping My HTML\n\nIt's most likely _templates\/ez-multipart-html.html.twig_.\n\n#### Other Variations\n\n```php"},{"id":"testing","title":"Unit Tests.","body":"To run the unit tests do the following:\n\n1. `composer install`\n2. `.\/vendor\/bin\/phpunit tests\/src\/Unit`"}]
